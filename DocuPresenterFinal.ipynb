Davenport  and Rajeev Ronanki    In 2013, the MD Anderson  Cancer Center launched a “moon shot”  project: diagnose and recommend treatment plans for certain  forms of cancer using IBM’s Watson cognitive system. But in 2017,  the project was put on hold after costs topped $62  million—and the  system had yet to be used on patients. At the same time, the cancer center’s IT group was experimenting with using cognitive  technologies to do much less ambitious jobs, such as making hotel  and restaurant recommendations for patients’ families,  determining which patients needed help paying bills, and  addressing staff IT problems. The results of these projects have  been much more promising: The new systems have contributed to  increased patient satisfaction, improved  financial performance , and a decline in time spent on tedious data entry by the hospital’s care  managers. Despite the setback on the moon shot, MD Anderson  remains committed to using cognitive technology—that is, next- generation artificial intelligence—to enhance cancer treatment, and is currently developing a variety of new projects at its center of  competency for cognitive computing. The contrast between the two approaches is relevant to anyone  planning AI initiatives. Our survey of 250 executives who are  familiar with their companies’ use of cognitive technology shows  that three-quarters of them believe that AI will substantially  transform their companies within three years. However, our study  of 152 projects in almost as many companies also reveals that  highly ambitious moon shots are less likely to be successful than  “low-hanging fruit” projects that enhance business processes. This  shouldn’t be surprising—such has been the case with the great  majority of new technologies  that companies have adopted in the  past. But the hype surrounding artificial intelligence has been  especially powerful, and some organizations have been seduced by  it. In this article, we’ll look at the various categories of AI being  employed and provide a framework for how companies should  begin to build up their cognitive capabilities in the next several  years to achieve their business objectives. Three Types of AI It is useful for companies to look at AI through the lens of business  capabilities rather than technologies. Broadly speaking, AI can  support three important business needs: automating business  processes, gaining insight through data analysis, and engaging  with customers and employees. See more HBR charts in Data & Visuals      Process automation.   Of the 152 projects we studied, the most common type was the  automation of digital and physical tasks—typically back-office  administrative and financial activities—using robotic process  automation technologies. RPA is more advanced than earlier  business-process automation tools, because the “robots” (that is,  code on a server) act like a human inputting and consuming  information from multiple IT systems. Tasks include: transferring data from email and call center systems into  systems of record—for example, updating customer files with  address changes or service additions; replacing lost credit or ATM cards, reaching into multiple  systems to update records and handle customer  communications; reconciling failures to charge for services across billing  systems by extracting information from multiple document  types; and “reading” legal and contractual documents to extract  provisions using natural language processing. RPA is the least expensive and easiest to implement of the  cognitive technologies we’ll discuss here, and typically brings a  quick and high return on  investment. (It’s also the least “smart” in  the sense that these applications aren’t programmed to learn and  improve, though developers are slowly adding more intelligence  and learning capability.) It is particularly well suited to working  across multiple back-end systems. At NASA, cost pressures led the agency to launch four RPA pilots in accounts payable and receivable, IT spending, and human  resources—all managed by a shared services center. The four  projects worked well—in the HR application, for example, 86% of  transactions were completed without human intervention—and are  being rolled out across the organization. NASA is now  implementing more RPA bots, some with higher levels of  intelligence. As Jim Walker, project leader for the shared services  organization notes, “So far it’s not rocket science.” One might imagine that robotic process automation would quickly  put people out of work. But across the 71 RPA projects we  reviewed (47% of the total), replacing administrative employees  was neither the primary objective nor a common outcome. Only a  few projects led to reductions in head count, and in most cases, the tasks in question had already been shifted to outsourced workers.  As technology improves, robotic automation projects are likely to  lead to some job losses in the future, particularly in the offshore  business-process outsourcing industry. If you can outsource a task,  you can probably automate it. Cognitive insight.   The second most common type of project in our study (38% of the  total) used algorithms to detect patterns in vast volumes of data  and interpret their meaning. Think of it as “analytics on steroids.”  These machine-learning applications are being used to: predict what a particular customer is likely to buy; identify credit fraud in real time and detect insurance claims  fraud; analyze warranty data to identify safety or quality problems in automobiles and other manufactured products; automate personalized targeting of digital ads; and provide insurers with more-accurate and detailed actuarial  modeling. Cognitive insights provided by machine learning differ from those  available from traditional analytics in three ways: They are usually  much more data-intensive and detailed, the models typically are  trained on some part of the data set, and the models get better— that is, their ability to use new data to make predictions or put  things into categories improves over time. Related Tools The Latest Research: AI Versions of machine learning (deep learning, in particular, which  attempts to mimic the activity in the human brain in order to  recognize patterns) can perform feats such as recognizing images  and speech. Machine learning can also make available new data for better analytics. While the activity of data curation has historically  been quite labor-intensive, now machine learning can identify  probabilistic matches—data that is likely to be associated with the  same person or company but that appears in slightly different  formats—across databases. GE has used this technology to  integrate supplier data and has saved $80  million in its first year by eliminating redundancies and negotiating contracts that were  previously managed at the business unit level. Similarly, a large  bank used this technology to extract data on terms from supplier  contracts and match it with invoice numbers, identifying tens of  millions of dollars in products and services not supplied. Deloitte’s  audit practice is using cognitive insight to extract terms from  contracts, which enables an audit to address a much higher  proportion of documents, often 100%, without human auditors’  having to painstakingly read through them. Cognitive insight applications are typically used to improve  performance on jobs only machines can do—tasks such as  programmatic ad buying that involve such high-speed data  crunching and automation that they’ve long been beyond human  ability—so they’re not generally a threat to human jobs. Cognitive engagement.   Projects that engage employees and customers using natural  language processing chatbots, intelligent agents, and machine  learning were the least common type in our study (accounting for  16% of the total). This category includes: intelligent agents that offer 24/7 customer service addressing  a broad and growing array of issues from password requests  to technical support questions—all in the customer’s natural  language; internal sites for answering employee questions on topics  including IT, employee benefits, and HR policy; product and service recommendation systems for retailers  that increase personalization, engagement, and sales— typically including rich language or images; and health treatment recommendation systems that help  providers create customized care plans that take into account  individual patients’ health status and previous treatments. The companies in our study tended to use cognitive engagement  technologies more to interact with employees than with customers.  That may change as firms become more comfortable turning  customer interactions over to machines. Vanguard, for example, is  piloting an intelligent agent that helps its customer service staff  answer frequently asked questions. The plan is to eventually allow  customers to engage with the cognitive agent directly, rather than  with the human customer-service agents. SEBank, in Sweden, and  the medical technology giant Becton, Dickinson, in the United  States, are using the lifelike intelligent-agent avatar Amelia to  serve as an internal employee help desk for IT support. SEBank has recently made Amelia available to customers on a limited basis in  order to test its performance and customer response.
